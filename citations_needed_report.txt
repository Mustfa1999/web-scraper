Paragraph 1: These civilizations arose in a region with no major navigable rivers, no beasts of burden, and difficult terrain impeded the movement of people and goods. Indigenous civilizations developed complex ritual and solar calendars, a significant understanding of astronomy, and forms of communication written in glyphs.
Paragraph 2: The history of Mexico before the Spanish conquest is known through the work of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Archeology" title="Archeology">archaeologists</a>, <a href="/wiki/Epigraphy" title="Epigraphy">epigraphers</a>, and ethnohistorians (students of indigenous histories, usually from indigenous points of view), who analyze <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mesoamerican" title="Mesoamerican">Mesoamerican</a> indigenous manuscripts, particularly <a href="/wiki/Aztec_codices" title="Aztec codices">Aztec codices</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mayan_codices" title="Mayan codices">Mayan codices</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mixtec_codices" title="Mixtec codices">Mixtec codices</a>.
Paragraph 3: Accounts are written by Spaniards at the time of the conquest (the <i><a href="/wiki/Conquistador" title="Conquistador">conquistadores</a></i>) and by Indigenous chroniclers of the postconquest period constitute the principal source of information regarding Mexico at the time of the Spanish Conquest.
Paragraph 4: The diet of ancient central and southern Mexico was varied, including domesticated corn (or <a href="/wiki/Maize" title="Maize">maize</a>), <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Squash_(plant)" title="Squash (plant)">squashes</a> such as pumpkin and butternut squash, common beans (pinto, kidney, navy and other common beans consumed today), tomatoes, peppers, cassavas, pineapples, chocolate, and tobacco. <a href="/wiki/Three_Sisters_(agriculture)" title="Three Sisters (agriculture)">The Three Sisters</a> (corn, squash, and beans) constituted the principal diet.<a class="external autonumber" href="https://www.foodtimeline.org/foodmaya.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>
Paragraph 5: The Mesoamericans had the concept of deities and religion, but their concept was very different from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Abrahamic" title="Abrahamic">Abrahamic</a> concepts. The Mesoamericans had a belief where everything, every element of the cosmos, the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars, which mankind inhabits, everything that forms part of nature such as animals, plants, water and mountains all represented a manifestation of the supernatural. In most cases, gods and goddesses are often depicted in stone reliefs, pottery decoration, wall paintings and in the various <a href="/wiki/Maya_civilization" title="Maya civilization">Maya</a>, and pictorial manuscripts such as <a href="/wiki/Maya_codices" title="Maya codices">Maya codices</a>, <a href="/wiki/Aztec_codices" title="Aztec codices">Aztec codices</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mixtec_codices" title="Mixtec codices">Mixtec codices</a>.
Paragraph 6: A great deal is known about the Aztec religion due to the work of the early mendicant friars in their work to convert the Indigenous peoples to Christianity. The writings of <a href="/wiki/Franciscans" title="Franciscans">Franciscans</a> Fray <a href="/wiki/Toribio_de_Benavente_Motolinia" title="Toribio de Benavente Motolinia">Toribio de Benavente Motolinia</a> and Fray <a href="/wiki/Bernardino_de_Sahag%C3%BAn" title="Bernardino de Sahagún">Bernardino de Sahagún</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dominican_Order" title="Dominican Order">Dominican</a> Fray <a href="/wiki/Diego_Dur%C3%A1n" title="Diego Durán">Diego Durán</a> recorded a great deal about <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nahua_peoples" title="Nahua peoples">Nahua</a> religion since they viewed understanding the ancient practices as essential for successfully converting the Indigenous populations to Christianity.
Paragraph 7: Although many indigenous manuscripts have been lost or destroyed, texts are known <a href="/wiki/Aztec_codices" title="Aztec codices">Aztec codices</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mayan_codices" title="Mayan codices">Mayan codices</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mixtec_codices" title="Mixtec codices">Mixtec codices</a> still survive and are of intense interest to scholars of the prehispanic era.
Paragraph 8: The fact that there was an existing prehispanic tradition of writing meant that when the Spanish friars taught Mexican Natives to write their own languages, particularly <a href="/wiki/Nahuatl" title="Nahuatl">Nahuatl</a>, an alphabetic tradition took hold. It was used in official documents for legal cases and other legal instruments. The formal use of native language documentation lasted until Mexican independence in 1821. Beginning in the late twentieth century, scholars have mined these native language documents for information about colonial-era economics, culture, and language.

Paragraph 9: During the pre-Columbian period, many city-states, kingdoms, and empires competed with one another for power and prestige. Ancient Mexico can be said to have produced five major civilizations: the Olmec, Maya, Teotihuacan, Toltec, and Aztec. Unlike other indigenous Mexican societies, these civilizations (with the exception of the politically fragmented Maya) extended their political and cultural reach across Mexico and beyond.
Paragraph 10: They consolidated power and exercised influence in matters of trade, art, politics, technology, and religion. Over a span of 3,000 years, other regional powers made economic and political alliances with them; many made war on them. But almost all found themselves within their spheres of influence.
Paragraph 11: The Olmec first appeared along the Atlantic coast (in what is now the state of <a href="/wiki/Tabasco" title="Tabasco">Tabasco</a>) in the period 1500–900 BC. The Olmecs were the first Mesoamerican culture to produce an identifiable artistic and cultural style, and may also have been the society that invented writing in Mesoamerica. By the Middle Preclassic Period (900–300 BC), Olmec artistic styles had been adopted as far away as the Valley of Mexico and Costa Rica.
Paragraph 12: <a href="/wiki/Maya_peoples" title="Maya peoples">Maya</a> cultural characteristics, such as the rise of the <i><a href="/wiki/Ajaw" title="Ajaw">ahau</a></i>, or king, can be traced from 300 BC onward. During the centuries preceding the classical period, Maya kingdoms sprang up in an area stretching from the Pacific coasts of southern Mexico and Guatemala to the northern <a href="/wiki/Yucat%C3%A1n_Peninsula" title="Yucatán Peninsula">Yucatán Peninsula</a>. The egalitarian Maya society of pre-royal centuries gradually gave way to a society controlled by a wealthy elite that began building large ceremonial temples and complexes.
Paragraph 13: The earliest known long-count date, 199 AD, heralds the classic period, during which the Maya kingdoms supported a population numbering in the millions. <a href="/wiki/Tikal" title="Tikal">Tikal</a>, the largest of the kingdoms, alone had 500,000 inhabitants, though the average population of a kingdom was much smaller—somewhere under 50,000 people. The Maya speak a diverse family of languages known as Mayan.
Paragraph 14: The civilization and cultural complex associated with the site is also referred to as Teotihuacan or Teotihuacano. Although it is a subject of debate whether Teotihuacan was the center of a state empire, its influence throughout <a href="/wiki/Mesoamerica" title="Mesoamerica">Mesoamerica</a> is well documented; evidence of Teotihuacano presence can be seen at numerous sites in <a href="/wiki/Veracruz" title="Veracruz">Veracruz</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Geography_of_Mesoamerica#Maya_Region" title="Geography of Mesoamerica">Maya region</a>. The Aztecs may have been influenced by this city. The ethnicity of the inhabitants of Teotihuacan is also a subject of debate.  Possible candidates are the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nahua_peoples" title="Nahua peoples">Nahua</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Otomi_people" title="Otomi people">Otomi</a> or <a href="/wiki/Totonac" title="Totonac">Totonac</a> ethnic groups.  Scholars have also suggested that Teotihuacan was a multiethnic state.
Paragraph 15: The Toltec culture is an archaeological <a href="/wiki/Mesoamerica" title="Mesoamerica">Mesoamerican</a> culture that dominated a state centered in <a href="/wiki/Tula_(Mesoamerican_site)" title="Tula (Mesoamerican site)">Tula, Hidalgo</a>, in the early post-classic period of <a href="/wiki/Mesoamerican_chronology" title="Mesoamerican chronology">Mesoamerican chronology</a> (ca 800–1000 CE). The later <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Aztec" title="Aztec">Aztec</a> culture saw the Toltecs as their intellectual and cultural predecessors and described Toltec culture emanating from Tollan (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nahuatl_language" title="Nahuatl language">Nahuatl</a> for Tula) as the epitome of civilization; indeed, in the Nahuatl language the word "Toltec" came to take on the meaning "artisan".
Paragraph 16: The Aztec oral and pictographic tradition also described the history of the Toltec empire giving lists of rulers and their exploits. Among modern scholars it is a matter of debate whether the Aztec narratives of Toltec history should be given credence as descriptions of actual historical events. While all scholars acknowledge that there is a large mythological part of the narrative some maintain that by using a critical comparative method some level of historicity can be salvaged from the sources, whereas others maintain that continued analysis of the narratives as sources of actual history is futile and hinders access to actual knowledge of the culture of Tula, Hidalgo.
Paragraph 17: Other controversy relating to the Toltecs include how best to understand reasons behind the perceived similarities in architecture and iconography between the archaeological site of Tula and the Maya site of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chich%C3%A9n_Itz%C3%A1" title="Chichén Itzá">Chichén Itzá</a> – no consensus has emerged yet about the degree or direction of influence between the two sites.
Paragraph 18: The Nahua peoples began to enter central Mexico in the 6th century AD. By the 12th century, they had established their center at <a href="/wiki/Azcapotzalco_(altepetl)" title="Azcapotzalco (altepetl)">Azcapotzalco</a>, the city of the Tepanecs.
Paragraph 19: The Mexica people arrived in the Valley of Mexico in 1248 AD. They had migrated from the deserts north of the Rio Grande<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

They may have thought of themselves as the heirs to the prestigious civilizations that had preceded them.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (August 2010)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> What the Aztec initially lacked in political power, they made up for with ambition and military skill. In 1325, they established the biggest city in the world at that time, <a href="/wiki/Tenochtitlan" title="Tenochtitlan">Tenochtitlan</a>.
Paragraph 20: Aztec religion was based on the belief in the continual need for regular offering of human blood to keep their deities beneficent; to meet this need, the Aztec sacrificed thousands of people. This belief is thought to have been common throughout the Nahuatl people. To acquire captives in times of peace, the Aztec resorted to a form of ritual warfare called <a href="/wiki/Flower_war" title="Flower war">flower war</a>. The Tlaxcalteca, among other Nahuatl nations, were forced into such wars.
Paragraph 21: In 1428, the Aztec led a war against their rulers from the city of Azcapotzalco, which had subjugated most of the Valley of Mexico's peoples. The revolt was successful, and the Aztecs became the rulers of central Mexico as the leaders of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Aztec_Triple_Alliance" title="Aztec Triple Alliance">Triple Alliance</a>. The alliance was composed of the city-states of <a href="/wiki/Tenochtitlan" title="Tenochtitlan">Tenochtitlan</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Texcoco_(Aztec_site)" title="Texcoco (Aztec site)">Texcoco</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Tlacopan" title="Tlacopan">Tlacopan</a>.
Paragraph 22: At their peak, 350,000 Aztec presided over a wealthy tribute-empire comprising 10 million people, almost half of Mexico's estimated population of 24 million. Their empire stretched from ocean to ocean, and extended into Central America. The westward expansion of the empire was halted by a devastating military defeat at the hands of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pur%C3%A9pecha_people" title="Purépecha people">Purepecha</a> (who possessed weapons made of copper). The empire relied upon a system of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Taxation" title="Taxation">taxation</a> (of goods and services), which were collected through an elaborate <a href="/wiki/Bureaucracy" title="Bureaucracy">bureaucracy</a> of tax collectors, courts, civil servants, and local officials who were installed as loyalists to the Triple Alliance.
Paragraph 23: The first Europeans to arrive in what is modern day Mexico were the survivors of a Spanish shipwreck in 1511.  Only two managed to survive <a href="/wiki/Ger%C3%B3nimo_de_Aguilar" title="Gerónimo de Aguilar">Gerónimo de Aguilar</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gonzalo_Guerrero" title="Gonzalo Guerrero">Gonzalo Guerrero</a> until further contact was made with Spanish explorers years later. On 8 February 1517 an expedition led by <a href="/wiki/Francisco_Hern%C3%A1ndez_de_C%C3%B3rdoba_(Yucat%C3%A1n_conquistador)" title="Francisco Hernández de Córdoba (Yucatán conquistador)">Francisco Hernández de Córdoba</a> left the harbor of <a href="/wiki/Santiago_de_Cuba" title="Santiago de Cuba">Santiago de Cuba</a> to explore the shores of southern Mexico.
Paragraph 24: During the course of this expedition many of Hernández' men were killed, most during a battle near the town of <a href="/wiki/Champot%C3%B3n_Municipality" title="Champotón Municipality">Champotón</a> against a <a href="/wiki/Maya_civilization" title="Maya civilization">Maya</a> army. He himself was injured, and died a few days shortly after his return to Cuba. This was the Europeans' first encounter with a civilization in the Americas with buildings and complex social organizations which they recognized as being comparable to those of the <a href="/wiki/Old_World" title="Old World">Old World</a>. <a href="/wiki/Hern%C3%A1n_Cort%C3%A9s" title="Hernán Cortés">Hernán Cortés</a> led a new expedition to Mexico landing ashore at present day <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Veracruz,_Veracruz" title="Veracruz, Veracruz">Veracruz</a> on 22 April 1519, a date which marks the beginning of 300 years of Spanish <a href="/wiki/Hegemony" title="Hegemony">hegemony</a> over the region.
Paragraph 25: In general the 'Spanish conquest of Mexico' denotes the conquest of the central region of Mesoamerica where the Aztec Empire was based.  The fall of the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan in 1521 was a decisive event, but the conquest of other regions of Mexico, such as Yucatán, extended long after Spaniards consolidated control of central Mexico. The <a href="/wiki/Spanish_conquest_of_Yucat%C3%A1n" title="Spanish conquest of Yucatán">Spanish conquest of Yucatán</a> is the much longer campaign, from 1551 to 1697, against the <a href="/wiki/Maya_peoples" title="Maya peoples">Maya peoples</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Maya_civilization" title="Maya civilization">Maya civilization</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Yucat%C3%A1n_Peninsula" title="Yucatán Peninsula">Yucatán Peninsula</a> of present-day Mexico and northern <a href="/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a>.
Paragraph 26: The Alliance <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ambushes" title="Ambushes">ambushed</a> indigenous ceremonies, such as during The Feast of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Huitzilopochtli" title="Huitzilopochtli">Huitzilopochtli</a>, which allowed the Spanish conquerors to avoid fighting the best Aztec warriors in direct armed battle.
Paragraph 27: Smallpox (<i>Variola major</i> and <i>Variola minor</i>) began to spread in Mesoamerica immediately after the arrival of Europeans. The indigenous peoples, who had no <a href="/wiki/Immune_system" title="Immune system">immunity</a> to it, eventually died in the millions. A third of all the natives of the Valley of Mexico succumbed to it within six months of Spaniards arrival.
Paragraph 28: Tenochtitlan was almost completely destroyed by fire and cannon fire. It was not a foregone idea that the site of Tenochtitlan would become the Spanish capital, but Cortés made it the capital.
Paragraph 29: Cortés imprisoned the royal families of the valley. To prevent another revolt, he personally tortured and killed <a href="/wiki/Cuauht%C3%A9moc" title="Cuauhtémoc">Cuauhtémoc</a>, the last Aztec Emperor; Coanacoch, the King of Texcoco, and <a href="/wiki/Tetlepanquetzal" title="Tetlepanquetzal">Tetlepanquetzal</a>, King of <a href="/wiki/Tlacopan" title="Tlacopan">Tlacopan</a>.
Paragraph 30: The Spanish had no intention to turn over Tenochtitlan to the Tlaxcalteca. While Tlaxcalteca troops continued to help the Spaniards, and Tlaxcala received better treatment than other indigenous nations, the Spanish eventually disowned the treaty. Forty years after the conquest, the Tlaxcalteca had to pay the same tax as any other indigenous community.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (May 2014)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
Paragraph 31: The capture of Tenochtitlan marked the beginning of a 300-year colonial period, during which Mexico was known as "<a href="/wiki/New_Spain" title="New Spain">New Spain</a>" ruled by a <a href="/wiki/Viceroy" title="Viceroy">viceroy</a> in the name of the Spanish monarch.  Colonial Mexico had key elements to attract Spanish immigrants: (1) dense and politically complex indigenous populations (especially in the central part) that could be compelled to work, and (2) huge mineral wealth, especially major silver deposits in the northern regions <a href="/wiki/Zacatecas" title="Zacatecas">Zacatecas</a> and <a href="/wiki/Guanajuato" title="Guanajuato">Guanajuato</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Viceroyalty_of_Peru" title="Viceroyalty of Peru">Viceroyalty of Peru</a> also had those two important elements, so that New Spain and Peru were the seats of Spanish power and the source of its wealth, until other viceroyalties were created in Spanish South America in the late 18th century.
Paragraph 32: This wealth made Spain the dominant power in Europe and the envy of England, France, and (after its independence from Spain) the Netherlands. Spain's silver mining and crown mints created high quality coins, the <a href="/wiki/Currency_of_Spanish_America" title="Currency of Spanish America">currency of Spanish America</a>, the silver <a href="/wiki/Peso" title="Peso">peso</a> or <a href="/wiki/Spanish_dollar" title="Spanish dollar">Spanish dollar</a> that became a global currency.
Paragraph 33: Spanish conquerors did not bring all areas of Aztec Empire under its control. After the fall of Tenochtitlan in 1521, it took decades of sporadic warfare to subdue the rest of <a href="/wiki/Mesoamerica" title="Mesoamerica">Mesoamerica</a>, particularly the Maya regions of southern New Spain and into what is now Central America. But Spanish conquests in the Zapotec and Mixtec regions of southern Mesoamerica were relatively rapid.
Paragraph 34: Outside the zone of settled Mesoamerican civilizations were nomadic northern <i>indios bárbaros</i> ("wild Indians") who fought fiercely against the Spaniards and their indigenous allies, such as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tlaxcalans" title="Tlaxcalans">Tlaxcalans</a>, in the <a href="/wiki/Chichimeca_War" title="Chichimeca War">Chichimeca War</a> (1576–1606). The northern indigenous populations had gained mobility via the horses that Spaniards had imported to the New World. The desert in the north was only interesting to Spanish because of its rich silver deposits.  The Spanish mining settlements and trunk lines to Mexico City needed to be made safe for supplies to move north and silver to move to south, to central Mexico.
Paragraph 35: The most important source of wealth was indigenous tribute and compelled labor, mobilized in the first years after the conquest of central Mexico through the <a href="/wiki/Encomienda" title="Encomienda">encomienda</a>. The encomienda was a grant of the labor of a particular indigenous settlement to an individual Spanish and his heirs. Conquerors expected to receive these awards and premier conqueror <a href="/wiki/Hern%C3%A1n_Cort%C3%A9s" title="Hernán Cortés">Hernán Cortés</a> in his letter to the Spanish king justified his own allocation of these grants.  Spaniards were the recipients of traditional indigenous products that had been rendered in tribute to their local lords and to the Aztec empire.  The first Spanish <a href="/wiki/Viceroy" title="Viceroy">viceroy</a>, Don <a href="/wiki/Antonio_de_Mendoza" title="Antonio de Mendoza">Antonio de Mendoza</a> has his name given to the title of an Aztec manuscript <a href="/wiki/Codex_Mendoza" title="Codex Mendoza">Codex Mendoza</a>, that enumerates in glyphic form the types of tribute goods and amounts rendered from particular indigenous towns under Aztec rule. The earliest holders of encomiendas, the encomenderos were the conquerors involved in the campaign leading to the fall of Tenochtitlan, and later their heirs and people with influence but not conquerors.  Forced labor could be directed toward developing land and industry in the area the Spanish encomenderos' Natives lived.  Land was a secondary source of wealth during this immediate conquest period. Where indigenous labor was absent or needed supplementing, the Spanish brought African slaves, often as skilled laborers or artisans, or as labor bosses of encomienda Natives.
Paragraph 36: During the three centuries of colonial rule, fewer than 700,000 Spaniards, most of them men, settled in Mexico.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (June 2018)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Europeans, Africans, and indigenous intermixed, creating a mixed-race <a href="/wiki/Casta" title="Casta">casta</a> population in a process known as <i>mestizaje</i>. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mestizos" title="Mestizos">Mestizos</a>, people of mixed European-indigenous ancestry, constitute the majority of Mexico's population.
Paragraph 37: Colonial Mexico was part of the <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Empire" title="Spanish Empire">Spanish Empire</a> and administered by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Viceroyalty_of_New_Spain" title="Viceroyalty of New Spain">Viceroyalty of New Spain</a>. The Spanish crown claimed all of the Western Hemisphere west of the line established between Spain and Portugal by the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Tordesillas" title="Treaty of Tordesillas">Treaty of Tordesillas</a>. This included all of North America and South America, except for Brazil. The viceroyalty of New Spain had jurisdiction over Spain's northern empire in the Americas. When Spain established a colony in the <a href="/wiki/Philippines" title="Philippines">Philippines</a> in the late sixteenth century, the Viceroyalty of New Spain had jurisdiction over it, since there was more direct contact between the two than the Philippines with Spain.
Paragraph 38: <a href="/wiki/Hern%C3%A1n_Cort%C3%A9s" title="Hernán Cortés">Hernán Cortés</a> had conquered the great empire of the <a href="/wiki/Aztecs" title="Aztecs">Aztecs</a> and established New Spain as the largest and most important Spanish colony. During the 16th century, <a href="/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a> focused on conquering areas with dense populations that had produced Pre-Columbian civilizations. These populations were a disciplined labor force and a population to convert to Christianity.
Paragraph 39: Territories populated by nomadic peoples were harder to conquer, and although the Spanish explored much of <a href="/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>, seeking the fabled "<a href="/wiki/El_Dorado" title="El Dorado">El Dorado</a>", they made no concerted effort to settle the northern desert regions in what is now the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> until the end of the 16th century (Santa Fe, 1598).
Paragraph 40: Colonial law with native origins but with <a href="/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spanish</a> historical precedents was introduced, creating a balance between local jurisdiction (the <a href="/wiki/Cabildo_(council)" title="Cabildo (council)">Cabildos</a>) and the <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Empire" title="Spanish Empire">Crown</a>'s, whereby upper administrative offices were closed to natives, even those of pure Spanish blood. Administration was based on a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Racial_separation" title="Racial separation">racial separation</a> of the population among the Republics of Spaniards, Natives and Mestizos, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Autonomous" title="Autonomous">autonomous</a> and directly dependent on the <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Empire" title="Spanish Empire">king</a>. The population of New Spain was divided into four main groups, or classes. The group a person belonged to was determined by racial background and birthplace. The most powerful group was the Spaniards, people born in Spain and sent across the Atlantic to rule the colony. Only Spaniards could hold high-level jobs in the colonial government.
Paragraph 41: The second group, called creoles, were people of Spanish background but born in Mexico. Many creoles were prosperous landowners and merchants. But even the wealthiest creoles had little say in government.
Paragraph 42: The third group, the mestizos, were people who had some Spanish ancestors and some Native ancestors. The word <i>mestizo</i> means "mixed" in Spanish.  Mestizos had a much lower position and were looked down upon by both the Spaniards and the creoles, who held the belief that people of pure European background were superior to everyone else.
Paragraph 43: The poorest, most marginalised group in New Spain was the Natives, descendants of pre-Columbian peoples. They had less power and endured harsher conditions than other groups. Natives were forced to work as laborers on the ranches and farms (called <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Haciendas" title="Haciendas">haciendas</a>) of the Spaniards and creoles.
Paragraph 44: In addition to the four main groups, there were also some black Africans in colonial Mexico. These black African were imported as laborers and shared the low status of the Natives. They made up about 4% to 5% of the population, and their mixed-race descendants, called <i>mulattoes</i>, eventually grew to represent about 9%.
Paragraph 45: From an economic point of view, <a href="/wiki/New_Spain" title="New Spain">New Spain</a> was administered principally for the benefit of the <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Empire" title="Spanish Empire">Empire</a> and its military and defensive efforts. Mexico provided more than half of the <a href="/wiki/Empire" title="Empire">Empire</a> taxes and supported the administration of all <a href="/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North</a> and <a href="/wiki/Central_America" title="Central America">Central America</a>. Competition with the metropolis was discouraged; for example cultivation of <a href="/wiki/Grape" title="Grape">grapes</a> and <a href="/wiki/Olive" title="Olive">olives</a>, introduced by <a href="/wiki/Hern%C3%A1n_Cort%C3%A9s" title="Hernán Cortés">Cortés</a> himself, was banned out of fear that these crops would compete with <a href="/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a>'s.
Paragraph 46: To protect the country from the attacks by English, French and Dutch <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pirates" title="Pirates">pirates</a>, as well as the Crown's revenue, only two ports were open to foreign trade—<a href="/wiki/Veracruz" title="Veracruz">Veracruz</a> on the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Atlantic" title="Atlantic">Atlantic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Acapulco" title="Acapulco">Acapulco</a> on the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pacific" title="Pacific">Pacific</a>. Pirates attacked, plundered and ravaged several cities like <a href="/wiki/Campeche" title="Campeche">Campeche</a> (1557), <a href="/wiki/Veracruz" title="Veracruz">Veracruz</a> (1568) and <a href="/wiki/Alvarado,_Veracruz" title="Alvarado, Veracruz">Alvarado</a> (1667).
Paragraph 47: Education was encouraged by the <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Empire" title="Spanish Empire">Crown</a> from the very beginning, and Mexico boasts the first primary school (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Texcoco,_State_of_Mexico" title="Texcoco, State of Mexico">Texcoco</a>, 1523), first university, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/University_of_Mexico" title="University of Mexico">University of Mexico</a>(1551) and the first printing press (1524) of the <a href="/wiki/Americas" title="Americas">Americas</a>. Indigenous languages were studied mainly by the religious orders during the first centuries, and became official languages in the so-called Republic of Natives, only to be outlawed and ignored after independence by the prevailing <a href="/wiki/Spanish_language" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>-speaking <a href="/wiki/Creole_peoples" title="Creole peoples">creoles</a>.
Paragraph 48: <a href="/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> produced important cultural achievements during the colonial period, such as the literature of seventeenth-century nun, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sor_Juana_In%C3%A9s_de_la_Cruz" title="Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz">Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Ruiz_de_Alarc%C3%B3n" title="Ruiz de Alarcón">Ruiz de Alarcón</a>, as well as cathedrals, civil monuments, forts and colonial cities such as <a href="/wiki/Puebla" title="Puebla">Puebla</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mexico_City" title="Mexico City">Mexico City</a>, <a href="/wiki/Quer%C3%A9taro" title="Querétaro">Querétaro</a>, <a href="/wiki/Zacatecas" title="Zacatecas">Zacatecas</a> and others, today part of Unesco's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/World_Heritage" title="World Heritage">World Heritage</a>.
Paragraph 49: The <a href="/wiki/Syncretism" title="Syncretism">syncretism</a> between indigenous and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Spanish_culture" title="Spanish culture">Spanish</a> cultures gave rise to many of nowadays Mexican staple and world-famous cultural traits like <a href="/wiki/Tequila" title="Tequila">tequila</a> (since the 16th century), <a href="/wiki/Mariachi" title="Mariachi">mariachi</a> (18th), <a href="/wiki/Jarabe" title="Jarabe">jarabe</a> (17th), <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Charros" title="Charros">charros</a> (17th) and the highly prized <a href="/wiki/Mexican_cuisine" title="Mexican cuisine">Mexican cuisine</a>, fruit of the mixture of European and indigenous ingredients and techniques.
Paragraph 50: American-born Spaniards (creoles), mixed-race castas, and Natives often disagreed, but all resented the small minority of Iberian-born Spaniards who monopolized political power. By the early 1800s, many American-born Spaniards believed that Mexico should become independent of Spain, following the example of the United States. The man who touched off the revolt against Spain was the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Catholic" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> priest Father <a href="/wiki/Miguel_Hidalgo_y_Costilla" title="Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla">Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla</a>. He is remembered today as the Father of Mexican Independence.
Paragraph 51: Inspired by the American and French Revolutions, Mexican insurgents saw an opportunity for independence in 1808 when Napoleon invaded Spain and the Spanish king <a href="/wiki/Charles_IV_of_Spain" title="Charles IV of Spain">Charles IV</a> was forced to abdicate. Napoleon placed his brother <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Bonaparte" title="Joseph Bonaparte">Joseph Bonaparte</a> on the Spanish throne.  For Spain and the Spanish Empire, this turn of events created a crisis of legitimacy of rule.  In Spain, resistance to the French resulted in the <a href="/wiki/Peninsular_War" title="Peninsular War">Peninsular War</a>. In New Spain, viceroy <a href="/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_de_Iturrigaray" title="José de Iturrigaray">José de Iturrigaray</a> proposed to provisionally form an autonomous government, with the support of American-born Spaniards on the <a href="/wiki/Cabildo_(council)" title="Cabildo (council)">city council</a> of Mexico City. Peninsular-born Spaniards in the colony saw this as undermining their own power, and <a href="/wiki/Gabriel_J._de_Yermo" title="Gabriel J. de Yermo">Gabriel J. de Yermo</a> led a coup against the viceroy, arresting him in September 1808. Spanish military officer <a href="/wiki/Pedro_de_Garibay" title="Pedro de Garibay">Pedro de Garibay</a> was named as viceroy by the Spanish conspirators. His tenure was brief, from September 1808 until July 1809, when he was replaced by <a href="/wiki/Francisco_Javier_de_Lizana_y_Beaumont" title="Francisco Javier de Lizana y Beaumont">Francisco Javier de Lizana y Beaumont</a>, whose tenure was also brief, until the arrival of viceroy <a href="/wiki/Francisco_Javier_Venegas" title="Francisco Javier Venegas">Francisco Javier Venegas</a> from Spain. Two days after his entry to Mexico City on 14 September 1810, Father <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Miguel_Hidalgo" title="Miguel Hidalgo">Miguel Hidalgo</a> made his call to arms in the village of Hidalgo. Spain was invaded by France and the Spanish king deposed and a usurper French king imposed. Like others in colonial Spanish America, New Spain's viceroy <a href="/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_de_Iturrigaray" title="José de Iturrigaray">José de Iturrigaray</a>, who was sympathetic to creoles, sought to create a legitimate government during the situation.  He was overthrown by powerful Peninsular Spaniards and hard-line Spaniards clamped down on any notion of Mexican autonomy. Creoles who had hoped that there was a path to Mexican autonomy, perhaps within the Spanish Empire, now saw that their only path was independence through rebellion against the colonial regime. There were a number of creole conspiracies. In northern Mexico, Father <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Miguel_Hidalgo" title="Miguel Hidalgo">Miguel Hidalgo</a>, creole militia officer <a href="/wiki/Ignacio_Allende" title="Ignacio Allende">Ignacio Allende</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Juan_Aldama" title="Juan Aldama">Juan Aldama</a> met to plot rebellion. When the plot was discovered in September 1810, Hidalgo called his parishioners to arms in the village of Dolores, touching off a massive rebellion in the region of the Bajío. It even had Filipino support in the Manila-born <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ramon_Fabi%C3%A9" title="Ramon Fabié">Ramon Fabié</a> an Engineer and Miner who supported Miguel Hidalgo in his revolt.
Paragraph 52: Those who overthrew the emperor then nullified the Plan of Iguala, which had called for a constitutional monarchy, as well as the Treaty of Córdoba, leaving them free to choose their whatever form of government they could agree on.  It was to be a federal republic, and 4 October 1824, the United Mexican States (Spanish: Estados Unidos Mexicanos) was established. The new constitution was partly modeled on the constitution of the United States. It guaranteed basic human rights and defined Mexico as a representative federal republic, in which responsibilities of government were divided  between a central government and a number of smaller units called states. It also defined Catholicism as the official and only religion of the republic. Central America did not join the federated republic and took a separate political path from 1 July 1823.
Paragraph 53: Mexico's establishment of a new, untried form of government did not bring stability. The army remained the political power, and the Roman Catholic Church the sole religious power. Both the army and the church retained special privileges in the new era.  General <a href="/wiki/Guadalupe_Victoria" title="Guadalupe Victoria">Guadalupe Victoria</a> was followed in office by General <a href="/wiki/Vicente_Guerrero" title="Vicente Guerrero">Vicente Guerrero</a>, gaining the position through a coup after losing the 1828 elections, the Conservative Party saw an opportunity to seize control and led a counter-coup under General <a href="/wiki/Anastasio_Bustamante" title="Anastasio Bustamante">Anastasio Bustamante</a>, who served as president from 1830 to 1832, and again from 1837 to 1841.
Paragraph 54: The inhabitants of Tejas declared the <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Texas" title="Republic of Texas">Republic of Texas</a> independent from Mexico on 2 March 1836 at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Washington-on-the-Brazos" title="Washington-on-the-Brazos">Washington-on-the-Brazos</a>. They called themselves Texans and were led mainly by recent <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Americans" title="Anglo-Americans">Anglo-American</a> settlers. At the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_San_Jacinto" title="Battle of San Jacinto">Battle of San Jacinto</a> on April 21, 1836, <a href="/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texan</a> militiamen defeated the Mexican army and captured General Santa Anna. The Mexican government refused to recognize the independence of Texas.
Paragraph 55: The <b>Texas Revolution</b> or <b>Texas War of Independence</b> was a military conflict between Mexico and settlers in the <a href="/wiki/Mexican_Texas" title="Mexican Texas">Texas</a> portion of the Mexican state <a href="/wiki/Coahuila_y_Tejas" title="Coahuila y Tejas">Coahuila y Tejas</a>.
Paragraph 56: The war lasted from October 2, 1835 to April 21, 1836. However, a war at sea between Mexico and Texas continued into the 1840s. Animosity between the Mexican government and the American settlers in Texas, as well as many Texas residents of Mexican ancestry, began with the <a href="/wiki/Siete_Leyes" title="Siete Leyes">Siete Leyes</a> of 1835, when Mexican President and General <a href="/wiki/Antonio_L%C3%B3pez_de_Santa_Anna" title="Antonio López de Santa Anna">Antonio López de Santa Anna</a> abolished the federal <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Constitution_of_1824" title="Constitution of 1824">Constitution of 1824</a> and proclaimed the more centralizing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/1835_Constitution_of_Mexico" title="1835 Constitution of Mexico">1835 constitution</a> in its place.
Paragraph 57: War began in Texas on October 2, 1835, with the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Gonzales" title="Battle of Gonzales">Battle of Gonzales</a>. Early Texian Army successes at <a href="/wiki/Goliad,_Texas" title="Goliad, Texas">La Bahia</a> and <a href="/wiki/San_Antonio" title="San Antonio">San Antonio</a> were soon met with crushing defeat at the same locations a few months later. The war ended at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_San_Jacinto" title="Battle of San Jacinto">Battle of San Jacinto</a> where General <a href="/wiki/Sam_Houston" title="Sam Houston">Sam Houston</a> led the <a href="/wiki/Texian_Army" title="Texian Army">Texian Army</a> to victory over a portion of the <a href="/wiki/Military_history_of_Mexico" title="Military history of Mexico">Mexican Army</a> under <a href="/wiki/Antonio_L%C3%B3pez_de_Santa_Anna" title="Antonio López de Santa Anna">Santa Anna</a>, who was captured soon after the battle. The end of the war resulted in the creation of the <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Texas" title="Republic of Texas">Republic of Texas</a> in 1836. In 1845, the U.S. Congress ratified Texas's petition for statehood.
Paragraph 58: In response to a Mexican massacre of a U.S. army detachment in disputed territory, the U.S. Congress declared war on May 13, 1846; Mexico followed suit on 23 May. The <a href="/wiki/Mexican%E2%80%93American_War" title="Mexican–American War">Mexican–American War</a> took place in two theaters: the western (aimed at California) and Central Mexico (aimed at capturing Mexico City) campaigns.
Paragraph 59: The city (at that time still walled) was defended by Mexican General Juan Morales with 3,400 men. Veracruz replied as best it could with artillery to the bombardment from land and sea, but the city walls were reduced.  After 12 days, the Mexicans surrendered. Scott marched west with 8,500 men, while Santa Anna entrenched with artillery and 12,000 troops on the main road halfway to Mexico City. At the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Cerro_Gordo" title="Battle of Cerro Gordo">Battle of Cerro Gordo</a>, Santa Anna was outflanked and routed.
Paragraph 60: Scott pushed on to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Puebla,_Puebla" title="Puebla, Puebla">Puebla</a>, Mexico's second largest city, which capitulated without resistance on 1 May—the citizens were hostile to Santa Anna. After the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Chapultepec" title="Battle of Chapultepec">Battle of Chapultepec</a> (13 September 1847), Mexico City was occupied; Scott became its military governor. Many other parts of Mexico were also occupied. Some Mexican units fought with distinction. One of the justly commemorated units was a group of six <a href="/wiki/Ni%C3%B1os_H%C3%A9roes" title="Niños Héroes">young Military College cadets</a> (now considered Mexican national heroes), who fought to the death defending their college during the Battle of Chapultepec.
Paragraph 61: Notable liberal politicians in the 1850s and 1860s include <a href="/wiki/Benito_Ju%C3%A1rez" title="Benito Juárez">Benito Juárez</a>, <a href="/wiki/Juan_%C3%81lvarez" title="Juan Álvarez">Juan Álvarez</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ignacio_Comonfort" title="Ignacio Comonfort">Ignacio Comonfort</a>, <a href="/wiki/Miguel_Lerdo_de_Tejada" title="Miguel Lerdo de Tejada">Miguel Lerdo de Tejada</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sebasti%C3%A1n_Lerdo_de_Tejada" title="Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada">Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada</a>, <a href="/wiki/Melchor_Ocampo" title="Melchor Ocampo">Melchor Ocampo</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mar%C3%ADa_Iglesias" title="José María Iglesias">José María Iglesias</a>, <a href="/wiki/Santiago_Vidaurri" title="Santiago Vidaurri">Santiago Vidaurri</a>, <a href="/wiki/Manuel_Doblado" title="Manuel Doblado">Manuel Doblado</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Santos_Degollado" title="Santos Degollado">Santos Degollado</a>.  Prominent conservatives of the era were generals <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/F%C3%A9lix_Zuloaga" title="Félix Zuloaga">Félix Zuloaga</a>, <a href="/wiki/Miguel_Miram%C3%B3n" title="Miguel Miramón">Miguel Miramón</a>, <a href="/wiki/Leonardo_M%C3%A1rquez" title="Leonardo Márquez">Leonardo Márquez</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tom%C3%A1s_Mej%C3%ADa" title="Tomás Mejía">Tomás Mejía</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mariano_Salas" title="José Mariano Salas">José Mariano Salas</a>, as well as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Juan_N._Almonte" title="Juan N. Almonte">Juan N. Almonte</a>, natural son of independence leader <a href="/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mar%C3%ADa_Morelos" title="José María Morelos">José María Morelos</a>.
Paragraph 62: The revolt led to the <a href="/wiki/Reform_War" title="Reform War">War of Reform</a> (December 1857 to January 1861), which grew increasingly bloody as it progressed and polarized the nation's politics. Many Moderates, convinced that the Church's political power had to be curbed, came over to the side of the Liberals.
Paragraph 63: For some time, the Liberals and Conservatives simultaneously administered separate governments, the Conservatives from Mexico City and the Liberals from Veracruz. The war ended with a Liberal victory, and liberal President Benito Juárez moved his administration to Mexico City.
Paragraph 64: Maximilian was a liberal, a fact that Mexican conservatives seemingly did not know when he was chosen to head the government. He favored the establishment of a limited monarchy that would share power with a democratically elected congress. This was too liberal for conservatives, while liberals refused to accept any monarch, considering the republican government of Benito Juárez as legitimate. This left Maximilian with few enthusiastic allies within Mexico. Meanwhile, Juárez remained head of the republican government. He continued to be recognized by the United States, which was engaged in its <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" title="American Civil War">Civil War</a> (1861–65) and at that juncture was in no position to aid Juárez directly against the French intervention until 1865.
Paragraph 65: France never made a profit in Mexico and its Mexican expedition grew increasingly unpopular. Finally in the spring of 1865, after the US Civil War was over, the US demanded the withdrawal of French troops from Mexico. Napoleon III quietly complied.  In mid-1867, despite repeated Imperial losses in battle to the Republican Army and ever decreasing support from Napoleon III, Maximilian chose to remain in Mexico rather than return to Europe.  He was captured and executed along with two Mexican supporters, immortalized in a famous painting by <a href="/wiki/%C3%89douard_Manet" title="Édouard Manet">Édouard Manet</a>. Juárez remained in office until his death in 1872.
Paragraph 66: In 1867 with the defeat of the monarchy and execution of Emperor Maximilian, the republic was restored and Juárez reelected. He continued to implement his reforms. In 1871, he was elected a second time, much to the dismay of his opponents within the Liberal party, who considered reelection to be somewhat undemocratic. Juárez died one year later and was succeeded by <a href="/wiki/Sebasti%C3%A1n_Lerdo_de_Tejada" title="Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada">Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada</a>.
Paragraph 67: Part of Juarez's reforms included fully secularizing the country. The Catholic Church was barred from owning property aside from houses of worship and monasteries, and education and marriage were put in the hands of the state.
Paragraph 68: Mexico was vulnerable to external shocks because of its weak banking system. The banking system was controlled by a small oligarchy, which typically made long-term loans to their own directors. The banks were the financial arms of extended kinship-based business coalitions that used banks to raise additional capital to expand enterprises. Economic growth was largely based on trade with the United States.
Paragraph 69: The Revolution grew increasingly broad-based, radical and violent. Revolutionaries sought far-reaching social and economic reforms by strengthening the state and weakening the conservative forces represented by the Church, the rich landowners, and foreign capitalists.
Paragraph 70: The Mexican Revolution was based on popular participation. At first, it was based on the peasantry who demanded land, water, and a more sympathetic national government. Wasserman finds that:
Paragraph 71: Porfirio Díaz announced in an interview to a US journalist <a href="/wiki/James_Creelman" title="James Creelman">James Creelman</a> that he would not run for president in 1910, at which point he would be 80 years old. This set off a spate of political activity by potential candidates, including <a href="/wiki/Francisco_I._Madero" title="Francisco I. Madero">Francisco I. Madero</a>, a member of one of Mexico's richest families. Madero was part of the Anti-Re-electionist Party, whose main platform was the end of the Díaz regime. But Díaz reversed his decision to retire and ran again. He created the office of vice president, which could have been a mechanism to ease transition in the presidency. But Díaz chose a politically unpalatable running mate, <a href="/wiki/Ram%C3%B3n_Corral" title="Ramón Corral">Ramón Corral</a>, over a popular military man, <a href="/wiki/Bernardo_Reyes" title="Bernardo Reyes">Bernardo Reyes</a> and popular civilian <a href="/wiki/Francisco_I._Madero" title="Francisco I. Madero">Francisco I. Madero</a>.  He sent Reyes on a "study mission" to Europe and jailed Madero. Official election results declared that Díaz had won almost unanimously and Madero received only a few hundred votes. This fraud was too blatant, and riots broke out. Uprisings against Díaz occurred in the fall of 1910, particularly in Mexico's north and the southern state of Morelos.  Helping unite opposition forces was a political plan drafted by Madero, the <a href="/wiki/Plan_of_San_Luis_Potos%C3%AD" title="Plan of San Luis Potosí">Plan of San Luis Potosí</a>, in which he called on the Mexican people to take up arms and fight against the Díaz government. The rising was set for November 20, 1910. Madero escaped from prison to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/San_Antonio,_Texas" title="San Antonio, Texas">San Antonio, Texas</a>, where he began preparing to overthrow Díaz—an action today considered the start of the <a href="/wiki/Mexican_Revolution" title="Mexican Revolution">Mexican Revolution</a>. Diaz tried to use the army to suppress the revolts, but most of the ranking generals were old men close to his own age and they did not act swiftly or with sufficient energy to stem the violence. Revolutionary force—led by, among others, <a href="/wiki/Emiliano_Zapata" title="Emiliano Zapata">Emiliano Zapata</a> in the South, <a href="/wiki/Pancho_Villa" title="Pancho Villa">Pancho Villa</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pascual_Orozco" title="Pascual Orozco">Pascual Orozco</a> in the North, and <a href="/wiki/Venustiano_Carranza" title="Venustiano Carranza">Venustiano Carranza</a>—defeated the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Army" title="Federal Army">Federal Army</a>.
Paragraph 72: Díaz resigned in May 1911 for the "sake of the peace of the nation". The terms of his resignation were spelled out in the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Ciudad_Ju%C3%A1rez" title="Treaty of Ciudad Juárez">Treaty of Ciudad Juárez</a>, but it also called for an interim presidency and new elections were to be held. <a href="/wiki/Francisco_Le%C3%B3n_de_la_Barra" title="Francisco León de la Barra">Francisco León de la Barra</a> served as interim president. The Federal Army, although defeated by the northern revolutionaries, was kept intact. <a href="/wiki/Francisco_I._Madero" title="Francisco I. Madero">Francisco I. Madero</a>, whose 1910 <a href="/wiki/Plan_of_San_Luis_Potos%C3%AD" title="Plan of San Luis Potosí">Plan of San Luis Potosí</a> had helped mobilize forces opposed to Díaz, accepted the political settlement. He campaigned in the presidential elections of October 1911, won decisively, and was inaugurated in November 1911.
Paragraph 73: Following the resignation of Díaz and a brief interim presidency of a high-level government official from the Díaz era, Madero was elected president in 1911.
Paragraph 74: The revolutionary leaders had many different objectives; revolutionary figures varied from liberals such as Madero to radicals such as Emiliano Zapata and Pancho Villa. As a consequence, it proved impossible to agree about how to organize the government that emerged from the triumphant first phase of the revolution. This standoff over political principles led quickly to a struggle for control of the government, a violent conflict that lasted more than 20 years.
Paragraph 75: Madero was ousted and killed in February 1913 during the <a href="/wiki/Ten_Tragic_Days" title="Ten Tragic Days">Ten Tragic Days</a>. General <a href="/wiki/Victoriano_Huerta" title="Victoriano Huerta">Victoriano Huerta</a>, one of Díaz's former generals, and a nephew of Díaz, <a href="/wiki/F%C3%A9lix_D%C3%ADaz_(politician)" title="Félix Díaz (politician)">Félix Díaz</a>, plotted with the US ambassador to Mexico, <a href="/wiki/Henry_Lane_Wilson" title="Henry Lane Wilson">Henry Lane Wilson</a>, to topple Madero and reassert the policies of Díaz.
Paragraph 76: Within a month of the coup, rebellion started spreading in Mexico, most prominently by the governor of the state of Coahuila, <a href="/wiki/Venustiano_Carranza" title="Venustiano Carranza">Venustiano Carranza</a> along with old revolutionaries demobilized by Madero, such as <a href="/wiki/Pancho_Villa" title="Pancho Villa">Pancho Villa</a>.  The northern revolutionaries fought under the name of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Constitutionalist_Army" title="Constitutionalist Army">Constitutionalist Army</a>, with Carranza as the "First Chief" (<i>primer jefe</i>).
Paragraph 77: The two rival armies of Villa and Obregón met on April 6–15, 1915 in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Celaya" title="Battle of Celaya">Battle of Celaya</a>. The frontal cavalry charges of Villa's forces were met by the shrewd, modern military tactics of Obregón. Constitutionalist victory was complete.  Carranza emerged in 1915 as the political leader of Mexico with a victorious army to keep him in that position.  Villa retreated north, seemingly into political oblivion. Carranza and the Constitutionalists consolidated their position as the winning faction, with Zapata remaining a threat until his assassination in 1919.
Paragraph 78: Venustiano Carranza promulgated a new constitution on February 5, 1917. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mexican_Constitution_of_1917" title="Mexican Constitution of 1917">Mexican Constitution of 1917</a>, with significant amendments in the 1990s, still governs Mexico.
Paragraph 79: Carranza was assassinated in 1920 during an internal feud among his former supporters over who would replace him as president.
Paragraph 80: A number of articles of the 1917 Constitution were at issue: a) Article 5 (outlawing monastic religious orders); b) Article 24 (forbidding public worship outside of church buildings); and c) Article 27 (restricting religious organizations' rights to own property). Finally, Article 130 took away basic civil rights of the clergy: priests and religious leaders were prevented from wearing their habits, were denied the right to vote, and were not permitted to comment on public affairs in the press.
Paragraph 81: The conflict claimed about 90,000 lives: 57,000 on the federal side, 30,000 Cristeros, and civilians and Cristeros killed in anticlerical raids after the war's end. As promised in the diplomatic resolution, the laws considered offensive by the Cristeros remained on the books, but the federal government made no organized attempt to enforce them. Nonetheless, persecution of Catholic priests continued in several localities, fueled by local officials' interpretation of the law.
Paragraph 82: Although most Latin American countries eventually entered the war on the Allies' side, Mexico and <a href="/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a> were the only Latin American nations that sent troops to fight overseas during World War II.
Paragraph 83: On both occasions, the Mexican peso was devalued, and, until 2000, it was normal to expect a big devaluation and recession at the end of each presidential term. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/1994_economic_crisis_in_Mexico" title="1994 economic crisis in Mexico">"December Mistake" crisis</a> threw Mexico into economic turmoil—the worst recession in over half a century.
Paragraph 84: The United States intervened rapidly to stem the economic crisis, first by buying pesos in the open market, and then by granting assistance in the form of $50 billion in loan guarantees. The peso stabilized at 6 pesos per dollar. By 1996, the economy was growing, and in 1997, Mexico repaid, ahead of schedule, all U.S. Treasury loans.
Paragraph 85: Zedillo oversaw political and electoral reforms that reduced the PRI's hold on power. After the <a href="/wiki/1988_Mexican_general_election" title="1988 Mexican general election">1988 election</a>, which was strongly disputed and arguably lost by the government, the IFE (Instituto Federal Electoral – <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Federal_Electoral_Institute" title="Federal Electoral Institute">Federal Electoral Institute</a>) was created in the early 1990s. Run by ordinary citizens, the IFE oversees elections with the aim of ensuring that they are conducted legally and impartially.
Paragraph 86: Per capita income is one-quarter that of the United States; income distribution remains highly unequal. Trade with the United States and Canada has tripled since the implementation of NAFTA. Mexico has free-trade agreements with more than 40 countries, governing 90% of its foreign commerce.
Paragraph 87: Fox was a very strong candidate, but an ineffective president who was weakened by PAN's minority status in Congress. Historian Philip Russell summarizes the strengths and weaknesses of Fox as president:
Paragraph 88: Despite imposing a cap on salaries of high-ranking public servants, Calderón ordered a raise on the salaries of the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Police_(Mexico)" title="Federal Police (Mexico)">Federal Police</a> and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Military_of_Mexico" title="Military of Mexico">Mexican armed forces</a> on his first day as president.
Paragraph 89: Calderón's government also ordered massive raids on drug cartels upon assuming office in December 2006 in response to an increasingly deadly spate of violence in his home state of Michoacán. The decision to intensify drug enforcement operations has led to an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mexican_Drug_War" title="Mexican Drug War">ongoing conflict</a> between the federal government and the Mexican drug cartels.
Paragraph 90: The administration has had to contend with the <a href="/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Mexico" title="COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico">coronavirus pandemic</a>. AMLO does not wear a face mask or practice social distancing. The number of cases has continued to rise, but Mexico has attempted the gradual reopening of the economy. At least 500 <a href="/wiki/Cubans" title="Cubans">Cuban</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Health_workers" title="Health workers">health workers</a> are helping tackle the new coronavirus in Mexico City, Mexican officials say, making it likely the largest contingent the island has deployed globally as part of its response to the pandemic.
